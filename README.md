#Portfolio Website

This is just a mockup of a PDF that a designer has supplied. 

It was created using Bootsrap

Just clone the directory then open up index.html 
from a javascript enabled browser. You should be able to see 
the website. The small icons at the bottom are clickable 
images and they will open up a little window with a deeper 
description of the featured work.

Note that this is a responsive design using almost no images so that it can load quickly on mobile devices with poor connections.
